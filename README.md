A web archive project to combat censorship



We are archiving the www to combat censorship.
Archival Methods
This site: Content likely to be politically censored will be uploaded to this site and searchable.
HTML archives: Pages likely to be censored will be archived as HTML snapshots and stored.
bookmarks.code4freedom.net: Powered by Wallabag, C4F Bookmarks brings archiving to the palm of your hand! Just upload a link and it is archived into your account. You can then choose to send that to us and we will link a wiki entry to it.

Archive rules
While our goal is to combat censorship by archiving content, some content we do not permit to be archived.

What can't be archived:
Memes
Censorship unlikely content (Food blogs, memes, etc)
Social media profiles and websites
Online stores
Useless pages (Terms and conditions, privacy policies, etc. These pages do not add useful information to the archive and only waste space.)
What can, and should, be archived:
News articles
Election information
Important posts on social networks
Information guides
Anonymity resources
Can I edit entries?
Well yes, and no. You can edit them, but only you will be able to see the changes. To make a permanent for all to see, you have to become a contributor on Github, which requires applying.

To apply, go to the Issue section of the repository, create a new issue with the tag "Contributor Application," and include a link to a public social media profile of yours (Does not have to include real name). This is to limit spam and verify authenticity.
